done:
 - some nice functionality H, phi <-- Hessian(E1, E2, kernel) or something like that
 - additionally, for P1 in E1 and P2 in E2, calling H(P1, P2) should return the right associated point
 - similarly for the Hessian H1 of the curve E1, instead of H.map_point(P1) could simply be H(P1)
 - return associated kernel together with jacobian from hesse
 - random sampling (sample on kummer and push back to Hessian)

low hanging fruit
 - pairings of degree 3 together with isotropy test of (3,3)-subgroups
 - simplyify canonical_isogeny

bit difficult
 - lift_x analogue?

more difficult
 - addition on H
 - morphism between H.jacobian() and H
 - given hyperell curve C, return Hessian
 - cubical arithmetic
 - general degree pairings on H
 - (2,2)-isogenies
