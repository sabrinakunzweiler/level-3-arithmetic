low hanging fruit
 - some nice functionality H, phi <-- Hessian(E1, E2, kernel) or something like that
 - additionally, for P1 in E1 and P2 in E2, calling H(P1, P2) should return the right associated point
 - random sampling (sample on kummer and push back to Hessian)

more difficult
 - addition on H
 - morphism between H.jacobian() and H
 - pairings on H
 - (2,2)-isogenies
